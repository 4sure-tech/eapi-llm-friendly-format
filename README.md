# Orbit Enterprise API

The **Orbit Enterprise API,** currently in version 0.2.0, developed by Northern Block, is a collection of APIs that can be used to build trusted digital identity solution. The Enterprise API provides support for issuance, verification, and storage of verifiable credentials in digital wallets. \
\
These verifiable credentials can be presented to any third-party that accepts these credentials, removing the need for call-homes to verify the credentialsâ€™ authenticity. This offers enormous privacy-preserving benefits for the holders of credentials, while allowing relying parties to digitally transform business processes, since high-integrity data can now be easily consumed.
