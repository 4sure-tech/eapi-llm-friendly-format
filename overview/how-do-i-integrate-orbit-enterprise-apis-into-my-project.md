# How do I integrate Orbit Enterprise APIs into my project?



### 1. Calling an Orbit Enterprise API

* Construct the Request: Use the appropriate HTTP method and headers (including your API key) to make the request to the API endpoint.
* Handle Responses: Check the API response for status codes to determine if the request was successful and handle any errors appropriately.



Example in JavaScript: (Related with Enterprise Issuer API)

```
const response = await fetch('/api/lob/{lob_id}/offer-to-contact', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "contactId": "fab6ae8c-3abb-4714-a6b1-a1e755083956",
      "attributes": [
        {
          "mime-type": "image/jpeg",
          "name": "favourite_drink",
          "value": "martini"
        }
      ],
      "credentialId": 2
    }),
});
const data = await response.json();

```



### **2. Process and Utilize the Data**

* Data Manipulation: After retrieving data from the API, process it as needed (e.g., filtering, transforming).
* Integration into Your Application: Use the data within your application (e.g., displaying it in the UI, storing it in a database).\


### **3. Error Handling and Optimization**

* Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling for scenarios such as network issues, API rate limits, and unexpected response formats.
* Optimize Requests: Minimize the number of API calls by caching responses, using webhooks for real-time updates, or batching requests when possible.\


### **4. Test the Integration**

* Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure the API integration works as expected.
* Mock APIs: Use tools like Postman or Mock Service Worker (MSW) to simulate API responses for testing purposes.\


### **5. Documentation and Maintenance**

* Document Your Integration: Clearly document how the API integration works, including any dependencies and configurations.
* Monitor for Changes: Keep an eye on the API provider for updates or changes in the API that may affect your integration.

***

### Best Practices

* Use Environment Variables: Store sensitive information, such as API keys, in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in your codebase.
* Rate Limiting: Be aware of the APIâ€™s rate limits to avoid being blocked or throttled.
* Version Control: Use versioning in your API requests to ensure compatibility as the API evolves.
* Security: Ensure that sensitive data is transmitted securely (using HTTPS) and follow best security practices.
