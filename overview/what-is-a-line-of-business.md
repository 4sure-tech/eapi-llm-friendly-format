# What is a Line of Business?

The LOB, or Line of Business, is the organization that will be using the Orbit Enterprise APIs to issue and digital credentials. You can register your Line of Business by calling the [_**Register LOB API**_](../api-modules/lob-api/register-lob.md).

Once the LOB is registered, the API will provide an API key, as well as the LOB ID, that will be included in all of the Enterprise API transactions. During the LOB onboarding process, the agents will be started and the LOB settings will be recorded. The LOB ID will tie all of the applicable transactions back to the appropriate organization.
