# Issuer API

Northern Block has created an Issuer API as part of the Orbit Enterprise API solution. The Issuer API can interact with peers without a connection or with those peers which have been established as contacts of the LOB.&#x20;

In the case of connectionless interactions, the credential offer is sent to the peer via email or can be made available as a QR code.&#x20;

In the case of contact-based interactions, connections are provided as a parameter when the APIs are called.\
