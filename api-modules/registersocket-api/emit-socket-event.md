# Emit Socket Event

The _**Emit Socket Event API**_ is called by Orbit Enterprise API to send payloads to the LOB's front-end application over the established web socket. Please note that this is an internal API called by the _Notify API_ and no external API will call the _Emit Socket Event_ API.

Events are emitted by the _Notify API_ during the following interactions between two parties:

* Establishing connections between two parties
* Issuance of verifiable credentials
* Verification of verifiable credentials

\
Note: Both parties have to register a socket to receive relevant notifications.\
\
In the above three events, the notification response payload data structure is:

```json
{   
     "payloadType": enum,
     "payload": {}
}
```

### Establishing Connections Between Two Parties

When establishing a connection between two parties, the Invited and the Inviter receive a notification.

The notification response payload data structure received by both parties is:

```json
{    
     "payloadType": enum,
     "payload": {
                    "contactId": string,
                    "state": string,
                    "message": string
               }
}
```

The Inviter (Faber) receives notification during the following events:&#x20;

<table><thead><tr><th width="130.77081298828125">Event Recipient</th><th width="200.4305419921875">Event</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Inviter</td><td>accepted-invitation</td><td>Invitation accepted by Invited</td></tr></tbody></table>

\
\
**You will find examples below of notification responses received by the Inviter.**\
\
